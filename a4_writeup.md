# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
Answer: The most difficult part of the tic-tac-toe was defining the class. I understand how to define the class and what that entails but I kept mixing up the syntax with java.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
Answer: To add a computer player it would have to recognize patterns in the tic-tac-toe game and implemt and put the best possible answer based off of the patterns. If the computer player is a dumb version then a randomizer could be used for the indexes but that would not be any fun to program.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
Answer: To make the best possible moves it would need to know the patterns of the game and decide where to place the X's or O's.
